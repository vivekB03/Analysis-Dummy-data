#📊 Social Media Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of my **internship at Rasheed Foundation**, where I worked on analyzing and visualizing **social media performance data** across platforms (LinkedIn, Meta, and X).  
The main objective was to understand **engagement patterns, reach trends, and content effectiveness** in order to optimize posting strategies.  

 🔎 Key Goals  
- Collect and clean raw social media campaign data.  
- Build **interactive Power BI dashboards** to visualize:  
  - Engagement vs Reach over time  
  - Platform contribution to total reach  
  - Posting time analysis (best time to post)  
  - Content type performance (announcements, case studies, events, industry insights, team updates)  
- Translate data into **actionable insights** that can guide social media strategy.

 📈 Features of the Dashboard  
- **Posting Time Analysis:** Identified which hours of the day drive the most likes and engagement.  
- **Engagement vs Reach Trend:** Compared engagement rates against reach to find high-performing slots.  
- **Platform Contribution:** Visualized share of total reach from LinkedIn, Meta, and X.  
- **Content-Type Breakdown:** Measured how different types of posts (carousel, announcement, case study, etc.) perform across platforms.  
- **KPI Cards:** Total Likes and Total Reach displayed for quick reference.

 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** – Data Visualization & Dashboarding  
- **Excel / CSV** – Data preprocessing & structuring  



 🚀 Key Learnings  
- Data visualization is not just about charts — it’s about **storytelling with data**.  
- Posting time and content type have a strong impact on engagement.  
- Each platform contributes differently, and strategies should be tailored accordingly.  
- Power BI can transform **raw data → interactive insights → strategic decisions**.
